Why download the CLAIRE 4 Interpreter ?
=======================================

Although CLAIRE is a compiled language, it is quite useful to use it in its simpler form of an interpreted language:

great for fast prototyping  (REPL), as any interpreted language such as Python, LISP or Clojure.
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop, together with the introspective capabilities of interpreted language,  it supports using the langguage for querying and debugging the system that you build.

As a stand alone file, the CLAIRE4 interpreter is very easy to install  and it does not hit the wall of administrative rights for compiling or installing.

CLAIRE is a very powerful expressive language, with first-class citizen support for sets, hypothetical reasonning or high order relations, in addition to being an object-oriented functional programming language.
